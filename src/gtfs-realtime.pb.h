 Depending on the value of ScheduleRelationship, a TripUpdate can specify:
 - A trip that proceeds along the schedule.
 - A trip that proceeds along a route but has no fixed schedule.
 - A trip that have been added or removed with regard to schedule.

 The updates can be for future, predicted arrival/departure events, or for
 past events that already occurred.
 Normally, updates should get more precise and more certain (see
 uncertainty below) as the events gets closer to current time.
 Even if that is not possible, the information for past events should be
 precise and certain. In particular, if an update points to time in the past
 but its update's uncertainty is not 0, the client should conclude that the
 update is a (wrong) prediction and that the trip has not completed yet.

 Note that the update can describe a trip that is already completed.
 To this end, it is enough to provide an update for the last stop of the trip.
 If the time of that is in the past, the client will conclude from that that
 the whole trip is in the past (it is possible, although inconsequential, to
 also provide updates for preceding stops).
 This option is most relevant for a trip that has completed ahead of schedule,
 but according to the schedule, the trip is still proceeding at the current
 time. Removing the updates for this trip could make the client assume
 that the trip is still proceeding.
